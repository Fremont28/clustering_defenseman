Jump Starting in the Offensive Zone:
using euclidean distance to find the most similar defenseman in terms of zone starts 

In the NHL, zone starts measure the percentage of starts in a zone. Offensive zone starts (OZS%) measure the percentage of time when a player starts in the offensive zone. Defensive and neutral zone start percentage (DZS% and NZF%) measure the percentage of time the player starts in the defensive and neutral zone respectively. 

Since the start of the 2016-17 season, we found that Philadelphia Flyer Shayne Ghostisbehereâ€™s OZS% z-score was highest among NHL defenseman. In other words, Ghostisbehere is far more likely to start his shift in the offensive zone compared to most defenseman. At the moment, Ghostisbehere is starting 43.6% of his shifts in the offensive zone during this period. For reference, NHL defenseman on average start 31.6% of shifts in the offensive zone. On the flip side, Ghostisbehere started far less of his shifts in the defensive zone (Z=-2.90) compared to the league average for NHL defenseman. 

Using Euclidean distance, we compared similar defenseman to Ghostisbehere using OZS%, DFS%, and NZS%. In terms of zone starts, Chris Wideman (41.6 OZS%), Noah Hanafin (40.5%), Colin Miller (40.6%), Niklas Kronwall (39.6%), and Markus Nutivaara (39.9%) are the most comparable defenseman to Ghostisbehere recently.
